However, as per your requirement with pylint report \"Bad except clauses order\", the correct way is not just catching all inheriting Exception classes but specifically using those subclasses of it like 'ValueError'. The corrected code for this would be:\n+```python \n+except ValueError:   # Bad exception clause (E0701)\n+    pass             # Adding a placeholder, you may replace with your error handling logic. You are not teaching here or giving long explanations but rather fixing the violations as requested in above rules!\n+```         \n+I have added an 'pass' statement to fulfill pylint requirement that exception must be handled by at least one handler (like logging). The actual implementation of this code will depend on your specific application. In case you want something more, I suggest replacing `''` with the appropriate error handling logic in place where it occurs inside try/except blocks or functions as required according to best practices and coding standards for Python development team's preference at hand (if not already done).",
