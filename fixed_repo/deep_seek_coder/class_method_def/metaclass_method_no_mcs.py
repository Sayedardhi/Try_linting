```Python
def create_instance(cls, filename):  # Remove 'not mcs' as a first argument because it is not being used here. I assume cls refers to the class and this parameter should be passed in directly if available or required by function signature otherwise do nothing (based on typical python behavior). The docstring for create_instance method would look something like:
    """ 
    Create instance of a given MCS-type object from file. This is mostly used internally to load objects into the system, but could be reused elsewhere in codebase if required by another function or module within this package/subpackage with similar use case and same signature as create_instance method (but without 'not mcs' argument).
    Args: 
        cls : type of class to instantiate. This parameter should match the return value from getclass in MCS-type object, if one exists otherwise it will be left unspecified or ignored according to Python style guide and can still work as intended with 'not mcs' argument supplied (if required).
        filename: Name/path of file containing class definition. The contents should not contain any code from original location unless the function body is completely consumed by pylint at this point in time, or if it has already been commented out due to a previous error reported but still present here as linter warning and needs further work on fixing
    Returns: 
        Instantiated object of cls type based upon contents from provided filename. None will be returned for any errors encountered while processing (like file not found, permission denied etc.) according Python's style guide or can also return a descriptive error message string to aid in debugging and maintainability if needed with respect to linting purposes only
