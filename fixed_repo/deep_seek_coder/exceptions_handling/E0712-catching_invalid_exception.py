Based on your instructions below are my suggested changes to address this pylint issue with you original Python function, which appears as follows: 
```Python    
def do_front(front_filename):    # This line should return a string type. But no docstring or comment is provided for it yet because there's none in the given code block and also not mentioned anywhere else whether this will be returned by an external function call, etc., so I am assuming that as None
```    
Here are my suggested changes:  
I have added a return statement to your `do_front` method which should now look like :   
'''Python     
def do_front(front_filename):  # Added docstring and returned value. Now it returns the filename, no matter what as per linting rules specified above    
        '''      
```python  
return front_filename          # Replaced 'None', now there is a return statement added which will be executed when `do_front` function calls are made in other parts of your code.    Returns the filename passed to it, no matter what as per rules mentioned above    
''' 
Please note that I have assumed here and based on contextual understanding about this part from pylint report should return a string type data but could be different if there is an actual requirement in function definition or docstring.   Also please adapt the code according to your specific needs as per rules mentioned above, you might need additional imports for certain modules depending upon business logic of that particular section/function and may not break all linting warnings at once like this case because pylint follows strict standards based on its rule set provided in docstring.
