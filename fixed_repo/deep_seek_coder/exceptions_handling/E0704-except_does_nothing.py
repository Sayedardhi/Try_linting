Here's how you can fix "E0704-except_does_nothing" violations by adding missing docstrings and returning only corrected lines of Python Code. 
I will correct the violation as per pylint rules, make necessary changes in code based on those fixes if any are provided:  
```python (Corrected python line)    # Except doesn’t do anything (#E0704-does_nothing should be replaced with actual functionality of exception and its cause#PylintRule26 does not have a fix for this rule, just need to add docstring if missing.)
Exception as e: 
        pass   """Exceptions raised by PIL Image module are handled here. In future versions (PIL v3), exceptions should be logged at the debug level.""" #PylintRule26 does not have a fix for this rule, just need to add docstring if missing in existing code segment#Exception handling is added within try block
``` 
Here's how you can correct it:  
Before `do_back` function call :  `except Exception as e: pass #Exceptions raised by PIL Image module are handled here. In future versions (PIL v3), exceptions should be logged at the debug level."""    -> Now add docstring with a description of what exception handling is done, and in which situations it's required
After `do_back` function call :  `except Exception as e:  # Exceptions raised by PIL Image module are handled here. In future versions (PIL v3), exceptions should be logged at the debug level."""    -> Now add docstring with a description of what exception handling is done, and in which situations it's required
```python  
def do_back(front_filename: str, shift_x: int ,shift_y :int  , back_filename): # Added type hints for function parameters. Docstrings are added at the end if missing or incomplete    -> Now add docstring with a description of what is expected as input and output from this method
```python   (Corrected python line)     ```     """Doing operation on image based in given shift_x,shift_y values. Background color will be set to back_filename.""" #PylintRule26 does not have a fix for this rule just need to add docstring if missing
```python   (Corrected python line)     ```     """Doing operation on image based in given shift_x,shift

# In real world scenarios where specific exceptions are mentioned in PYLINT report, we should address these and include them here as per rules above: no unrelated code included/removed etc. For now I have kept the module imports for completeness of task at hand.

    result = perform_somehting()   # Corrected line - 'perform_something' should be replaced with a correct function or operation depending upon the context of your program and its functionality requirements. It would also need proper handling in case there is no such thing as `result`, which might not have been defined elsewhere (or it could just lack docstring).
    
    if result:   # If-statement requires an expression - corrected to make sure this line only executes when 'if' condition returns True.  It would depend on your specific program requirements and functionality in context of the `result` variable itself or its value, not with respecting PEP8 rules about return statements for functions that have no explicit result (like a recursive function).
        print(f"Result is {str(type)}") # Corrected to match correct indentation syntax. It will replace '{result}' by the actual `result` value in your case, based on its type and what needs be printed or stored there later downstream of this line if needed (like file saving).
    else:  # Else-statement does not require an expression - no need to add a newline after it. It will replace 'else' by the actual content in your case, based on its functionality and what needs be done with `result` afterwards downstream of this line if needed (like looping through some data or just printing out message).
        print("No result found!")  # Corrected to match correct indentation syntax. It will replace 'print' by the actual content in your case, based on what needs be printed/stored there downstream of this line if needed (like saving a file with contents or just printing out message).
    
    return result   # All lines should have been replaced to align properly against PEP8 style guide. It will replace 'return' by the actual content in your case, depending on what you actually want as output from function after this line is executed (like storing a file with data or printing out message).  If `result` has already appeared at that point and isn’t used elsewhere else where within body of if-statement then it can be removed.
