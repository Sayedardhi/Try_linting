Here's your corrected Python script using Pylint with warnings disabled (since you mentioned that we should not break up a line of code or add lines, and disable linter warning):

The pylint warning you provided suggests that there are some exceptions being raised (width is zero), but not classes or instances, and so it's a bit unclear how to fix this. However if the issue was related specifically with width in your original piece of code which seems more like an indentation error rather than logical mistake then here goes:
```python 
raise ValueError("Width cannot be zero") # Raising exception for invalid input (W0713)    `enter_code, ```(width == 0), "Value should not exceed maximum allowed value"   (# Width is too large or negative. The entered width exceeds the allowable range of 2 to N! Entering a number outside this limit.)
```    # Raising exception for invalid input (W0713)    `enter_code, ```(width == 0), "Value should not exceed maximum allowed value"   (# Width is too large or negative. The entered width exceeds the allowable range of 2 to N! Entering a number outside this limit.)
```python      # Raising exception for invalid input (W0713)    `enter_code, ```(width == 0), "Value should not exceed maximum allowed value"   (# Width is too large or negative. The entered width exceeds the allowable range of 2 to N! Entering a number outside this limit.)
