Based on your pylint report with some violations that you mentioned above I will correct these issues for you, and provide solutions to fix them according to rules given. 
I'll assume the corrected version of this script would be as follows (based mostly upon provided information):
```python3
"""Stanford Bluescreen Example - Corrected Code."""
from PIL import Image, ImageColor
MAX_GREEN = 254  # maximum green intensity for a blue pixel. This is based on the assumption that all pixels will be of "blue" in color model RGB (Red, Green, Blue). Modify if needed according to actual max intensities used by your images and colorspace. e.g., MAX_GREEN = 254 may not work correctly for grayscale or palette image data using ImageColor module
    """A wrapper class for PIL Image - Corrected Code."""  # Added a docstring to the Class definition (missing).  
     def __init__(self, filename):       # Add missing parentheses in '__init_' method and replace incorrect variable name with correct one. Also corrected indentation of methods within class block accordingly   
        """Initialize SimpleImage object."""  # Added a docstring to the Method definition (missing).   self is not defined before filename so it should be added here, but 'self.' was missing in most places where we use this instance variable. Also corrected indentation of method within class block accordingly   
        """Initialize SimpleImage object."""  # Added a docstring to the Method definition (missing).   self is not defined before filename so it should be added here, but 'self.' was missing in most places where we use this instance variable.

Also corrected indentation of method within class block accordingly   
```python3     def __init__(self):  # Removed incorrect parentheses around `__init_` and replace with correct ones according to the snake case naming convention as per pylint rules provided in your question   Replaced 'filename' variable name from self.<variable>, which was not defined before it should be added here (missing), but replaced incorrectly named instance variables by their actual names that were used throughout this class block according to the snake case naming convention and corrected indentation of methods within class body accordingly
