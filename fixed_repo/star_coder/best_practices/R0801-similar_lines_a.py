            The function is called when the linter reports issues. It takes a string of the original code and a list of strings of the pylint report as arguments. 
            Each element in the list is one line from the pylint report for that specific issue. 
            This function will return the corrected code with all the fixes to make the report disappear, by replacing each error message with its correction.

            Parameters
            ----------
            original_code: str
                The string of the original code. It has been already edited.
            pylint_report: list[str]
                A list of strings that contain one line from the report for every issue found by the linter.
                Example:
                    ```python
                        Missing function or method docstring

                         - Return only the corrected code within the specific markers, and provide a rationale for each change.
                         - Add a module docstring at the beginning of the code if missing, as suggested by the linter. You can use the name of the file as the module name.
                         - If a linting rule requires you to break up a line of code or add a line, please do so.
                         - Do not put random imports that were not part of the original code.
                         - Do not just leave sections of the code to be filled in by the user; fully complete the code.
                         - Do not just disable the linter warning but actually fix it
                         - It is imperative that you do not change the functionality of the code unless directly needed by the linter. So keep most of the code from the original file and fix what's needed. This is imperative, as the code is being linted for a specific purpose, and changing the functionality could have unintended consequences.
