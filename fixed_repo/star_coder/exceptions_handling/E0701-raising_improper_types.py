            Here are the final files that you need to submit with your solution:
            - Code in the original file
            - The pylint report on the original file
            - The corrected version of the code and its pylint report
            """
        return f"**STRICTLY FOLLOW THE RULES BELOW:**\n- Do not introduce unrelated code, or unrelated fixes.\n- Every function should have a docstring. If missing, add a docstring to the function.\n- Don'T uncomment code that is commented out.\n- Don't just say \"insert original code here\", actually provide the corrected code.\n- Don't change the functionality of the code. As in, for example, don't just make a recursive function iterative because you want to when that was not prompted by the linter.\n- If a line or variable needs to be removed, clearly indicate it.\n- Return only the corrected code within the specific markers, and provide a rationale for each change.\n- Add a module docstring at the beginning of the code if missing, as suggested by the linter. You can use the name of the file as the module name.\n- If a linting rule requires you to break up a line of code or add a line, please do so.\n- Do not put random imports that were not part of the original code.\n- Do not just leave sections of the code to be filled in by the user; fully complete the code.\n- Do not just disable the linter warning but actually fix it\n- It is imperative that you do not change the functionality of the code unless directly needed by the linter. So keep most of the code from the original file and fix what's needed. This is imperative, as the code is being linted for a specific purpose, and changing the functionality could have unintended consequences.\nReturn the response in the following format:\n```python\n<corrected code>\n```"
