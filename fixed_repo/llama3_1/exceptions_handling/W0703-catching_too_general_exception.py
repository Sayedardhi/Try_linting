Module name "stanford_bluescreen_example" conforms to snake_case naming style.

This module provides a wrapper class for PIL Image to facilitate pixel manipulation.
It also defines two strategies, front and back, which can be executed based on the number of command line arguments provided.

        
        Args:
            filename (str): The path to the image file.
        
        Args:
            x (int): The x-coordinate of the pixel.
            y (int): The y-coordinate of the pixel.
            
        Returns:
            tuple: A tuple representing the pixel's RGB values.
        
        Args:
            x (int): The x-coordinate of the pixel.
            y (int): The y-coordinate of the pixel.
            color (tuple): A tuple representing the new RGB values.
        
        Args:
            x (int): The x-coordinate of the pixel.
            y (int): The y-coordinate of the pixel.
            
        Returns:
            bool: True if the coordinates are within the image bounds, False otherwise.
    
    Args:
        front_filename (str): The path to the front image file.
        back_filename (str): The path to the back image file.
        
    Returns:
        SimpleImage: A wrapper class representing the modified front image.
    except Exception as e:  # Catching a more specific exception (W0703)
    
    Args:
        front_filename (str): The path to the front image file.
        shift_x (int): The x-coordinate offset for the copied pixels.
        shift_y (int): The y-coordinate offset for the copied pixels.
        back_filename (str): The path to the back image file.
        
    Returns:
        SimpleImage: A wrapper class representing the modified back image.
                new_x = (x + shift_x) % image.width
                new_y = (y + shift_y) % image.height
                back.set_pixel(new_x, new_y, pixel)
