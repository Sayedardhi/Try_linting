Module name "C0121-comparison" conforms to snake_case naming style
This module shows front and back strategies for image manipulation.
The functions are mostly complete, missing only the key if-logic line.

                # Removed the back_pixel variable and directly used back.get_pixel
                image.set_pixel(x, y, back.get_pixel(x, y))
                # Added a check to ensure the destination point is within bounds
                if back.in_bounds(dest_x, dest_y):
    # Added a docstring to explain the usage of the program
        print('Usage:')
        print('  front-image back-image (for front strategy)')
        print('  front-image shift-x shift-y back-image (for back strategy)')
